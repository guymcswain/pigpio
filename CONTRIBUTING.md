## Submitting a New Issue
If you are reporting a **bug** or defect, please provide the steps to reproduce the problem you are describing.
Ideally, provide a simple script that will reproduce the issue.  Also provide a description of the hardware and 
software types and versions used in your application/test environment.

If you are requesting a feature or **enhancement** to the library software, be aware that the chances for acceptance are low. 
This is primary due to the fact that original author/owner of the library is not able to dedicate the time required for 
this level of support.  *See creating a pull-request.*

Support issues will be labeled with **question** for the community of contributors and users who are encouraged to 
provide assistance through their comments. Before you submit a support issue, please refer to the links below for sources
of information on the library:
*  link to pigpio website FAQ
*  website examples
*  the wiki (future support enhancements are likely to be found here).
